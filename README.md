# Social-Networks-Analysis-networkx-4
In this study project we learned to model an epidemic on graphs in order to perform simulations to predict possible scenarios.
The work is divided into two parts in which we perform the simulations for modeling the epidemic.
In the first part we try to model the epidemic according to the SIR, SIS models with parameters of the probability of being infected, how long a person will be infected and for how many epochs we will perform the simulation.
In the second part we try to model vaccination policy so that the vaccines will be distributed most effectively to the people who have fallen ill.
With the help of vaccine network modeling we can stop the epidemic as soon as possible.
We tested methods of vaccine distribution according to indices of centrality, randomness and probability of mortality.
